# Modules

The goal is to let you add and remove the modules you want.

Available modules:

* [Key modifiers](www.github.com/reed-tf2/key-modifiers/)
* [Weapon settings](www.github.com/reed-tf2/weapon-settings/)
* [Quick loadout switch](www.github.com/reed-tf2/loadout-switch/)
* [Quick class switch](www.github.com/reed-tf2/class-switch/)

## Working with modules

Some of these only need to be called [when the game loads](../autoexec.cfg), and others need to be called with [every class change](../classes/base_class.cfg) in order to establish a starting point.
