# Modules

The goal is to let you add and remove the modules you want.

Available modules:

* [Quick loadout switch](https://github.com/reed-tf2/quick-loadout-switch)
* Key modifiers
* Weapon settings
* Quick class switch

## Working with modules

Some of these only need to be called [when the game loads](../autoexec.cfg), and others need to be called with [every class change](../classes/base_class.cfg) in order to establish a starting point.
