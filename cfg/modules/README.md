# Modules

The goal is to let you add and remove the modules you want.

Available modules:

- [Key modifiers](https://github.com/reed-tf2/key-modifiers)
- [Weapon settings](https://github.com/reed-tf2/reed-config/blob/master/cfg/modules/weapon_settings.cfg)
- [Quick loadout switch](https://github.com/reed-tf2/quick-loadout-switch)
- [Quick class switch](https://github.com/reed-tf2/quick-class-switch)
- [Silly](https://github.com/reed-tf2/reed-config/blob/master/cfg/modules/silly.cfg)

## Working with modules

Some of these only need to be called [when the game loads](https://github.com/reed-tf2/reed-config/blob/master/cfg/autoexec.cfg), and others need to be called [with every class change](https://github.com/reed-tf2/reed-config/blob/master/cfg/classes/base_class.cfg) in order to establish a starting point.
